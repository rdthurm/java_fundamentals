Without running the code below, please tell me what it will print.

Similar to the last exercise, I haven't seen cases like "Parent c = new Child();" where Parent and Child don't match
like normal. So I'm unsure but my guess is that this program will print "Child called" since c will be a new Child object.

public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
    c.doSomething();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public void doSomething()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public void doSomething()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
