     Perform the following tasks using the CLI and copy and paste the commands and results below

     1. Navigate to CodingNomads folder (or the space you have create for this project)
        cd Documents/CodingNomads
     2. Create new folder Terminal_testing
        mkdir Terminal_testing
     3. Inside of folder Terminal_testing,
         a. create 3 new .txt files all with different names
            cd Terminal_testing
            touch one.txt two.txt three.txt
         b. print the directory path
            pwd
         c. list the contents of the folder
            ls -al
     5. Inside of folder Terminal_testing, create a new folder
        mkdir new_folder
     6. Copy a file from Terminal_testing to the new folder
        cp one.txt ./new_folder
     7. Move a different file from Terminal_testing to the new folder

     8. Demonstrate removing:
         a. A file
            rm three.txt
         b. A folder
            rm -r new_folder
     9. CHALLENGE:
         a. Use $ vim to write some text inside a file
         b. Use $ cat print contents of file
         c. Use $ grep to search for a word inside file

Example Output (pwd):
    1. Cadens-MacBook-Pro:CodingNomads cadenmackenzie$ pwd
