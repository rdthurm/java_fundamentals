*  MySQL Exercise 3:
*
*   Now that you have your air travel database all set up and populated, please demonstrate how to:
*
*       1.) Query all flights on a specific day
            SELECT * FROM Flight WHERE Flight.TakeoffDate = "02/09/2021";
*       2.) Query all flights between two specific cities on a specific day
            SELECT * FROM Flight f
            WHERE f.TakeoffDate = "02/07/2021"
            AND f.StartPort = "2"
            AND f.EndPort = "6";
*       3.) Query all passengers on a specific flight between two specific cities today
            SELECT p.PassengerID, p.FirstName, p.LastName, f.StartPort, f.EndPort
            FROM Passenger p
            JOIN Ticket t USING (PassengerID)
            JOIN Flight f USING (FlightID)
            WHERE f.StartPort = "1"
            AND f.EndPort = "2"
            AND f.Date = "2021-02-08";
*       4.) Query the flight information for a specific passenger on a specific flight
            The way I have my database set up, there is no flight information regarding a specific passenger.
            There IS ticket information that is specific to one flight and one passenger, such as the seat number.
            The query for that would simply be:
            SELECT t.SeatNumber FROM Ticket t
            WHERE t.PassengerID = "18" AND t.FlightID = "1000";
*       5.) Query the passenger information for a specific user on a specific flight yesterday
            SELECT * from Passenger p
            JOIN Ticket t USING (PassengerID)
            JOIN Flight f USING (FlightID)
            WHERE f.FlightID = "1005"
            AND p.PassengerID = "17";
*       6.) Query the number of flights between two specific cities this week, month, and year
            SELECT count(f.FlightID) as Num_Flights from Flight f
            WHERE f.StartPort = "1" AND f.EndPort = "8"
            AND f.Date BETWEEN "2020-02-08" AND "2021-02-09"; # Adjust first date to change range
*       7.) Query the number of passengers that travelled between two specific cities today, this week, month and year
            SELECT count(p.PassengerID) as Num_Passengers from Passenger p
            JOIN Ticket t USING (PassengerID)
            JOIN Flight f USING (FlightID)
            WHERE f.StartPort = "1" AND f.EndPort = "8"
            AND f.Date BETWEEN "2020-01-01" AND "2021-02-28"; # Adjust first date to change range
*       8.) Insert records for new flights between airports
            INSERT INTO Flight (PlaneID, AirlineID, StartPort, EndPort, Date) VALUES ("15", "5", "1", "5", "2021-03-09");
*       9.) Insert records for new tickets and passengers on specific flights
            INSERT INTO Ticket (PassengerID, FlightID, Price, Class, SeatNumber) VALUES ("12", "1017", "400", "Business", "E6");
            INSERT INTO Ticket (PassengerID, FlightID, Price, Class, SeatNumber) VALUES ("10", "1017", "800", "First Class", "B1");
*       10.) Update meal preference (or something similar) for a specific passenger on a specific flight
            UPDATE Passenger
            SET PrefersWindow = '1'
            WHERE PassengerID = '9';


*       Bonus: Have some fun - get creative - what else can you do? Flex those SQL muscles and show us what
*           you've got! :)
